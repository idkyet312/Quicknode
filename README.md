## Features

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Locate your `.katana` directory (usually in your home folder).  
   The `.katana` folder should already exist if you've run Katana before.

3. Inside `.katana`, ensure a `Tabs` directory exists. If not, create it:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.katana/Tabs
   ```

4. Copy the `Quicknode` folder into the `Tabs` directory:

   ```bash
   cp -r Quicknode ~/.katana/Tabs/
   ```

Katana will load the **Quicknode** tab the next time it launches.
